### Metro Auto Staff - Front End Repo

We built an AI voice assistant that leverages OpenAI speech-to-speech model together with the Stockholm Public Transport (SL) API to provide information to travellers within the Stockholm Metro,
regarding travel routes, ticket types and more.

For the front-end part of the repo, we used Lovable to create the majority of it, whilst we built the backend ourselves in a separate repo.
